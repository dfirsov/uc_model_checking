* Define testing scenarios and validate that bridge acts as it is supposed to.

+ Define the main properties (soundness, liveness) of the bridge and check.

* Look at the possible attack vectors (e.g., injects by diffuse) and recheck the properties.

* Decide which functionalities might have "non-responsive" simulator and recheck the properties.

* add
   - dynamic logging
   - dynamic simulator

* Play with different combination of bridge parameters (latency, threshold, apl, etc.).

* Write README.md

* Upload the code to anonymized repository.

* Proofread the paper.
